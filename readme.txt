Now includes support for custom menu to be used for anchor points on the full width blank template.

NEW: Support for custom post templates now included. Your theme/child theme must have custom post templates with in it for this function to work.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**With this plugin do I still need Elementor and a theme?**

Yes. This plugin acts as a helper or go between the Elementor Page builder and your current theme (including child themes) by facilitating the missing true full width templates.

**Will the templates work with any theme?**
Yes and No. The short answer is yes, you will be able to select the included templates. However, not all themes are supported in terms of the required styling and you may therefore need to add some custom css for your desired theme.

**Why a blank template?**
Ever wanted to build Landing pages, sales pages or display specific pages without the clutter and distruction of header items, sidebar widgets and footer items? Now you can.

**I see that support for anchor menu has been added, what is this?**
Anchors a point on a template that are attached to a specific menu item - upon click on the menu item the anchor position will scroll in to the viewport.

**How do I use this new feature?**
Please visit [Build With Elementor: Anchor Menus](http://buildwithelementor.com/custom-menu/) to get an over view of how it all works.

** I've update to version 1.0.2 but don't see the templates for posts, why?**
As with the current state of WordPress, custom post templates are only supported via themes and not plugins.   
To be able to use the new feature your theme needs to have a template with the tag "Post Template Name: TemplateName".   
If your theme does not have any templates you can copy the sample templates provided in the folder templates/sample-post-templates in this plugin.   
To understand how this works please download the free child theme for Actions from here: [Actions Child](http://buildwithelementor.com/blog/actions-elementor-child-theme/) - this can be used out of the box if desired.   

Further details will be available near the time of the release.
